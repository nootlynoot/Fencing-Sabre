# Fencing-Sabre
Yr3 FYP. This is my final year project that I worked on as the programming lead for my third year. We decided to tackle the difficult genre of fighting games and decided to make one based on fencing. The game features a priority based scoring system which mimics real world fencing regulations as well as realistic move sets. Personally I am in charge of all animations, visual and sound effects as well as certain game mechanics.
